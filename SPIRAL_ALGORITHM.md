# Spiral Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the bounded spiral flight path generation algorithm with neural network training optimizations. The algorithm creates exponential spiral patterns with differentiated altitude logic for enhanced AI training data collection.

## Core Mathematical Foundation

### Exponential Spiral Formula

```python
r(t) = r₀ * exp(α * t)
where α = ln(r_hold/r₀)/(N*Δφ) * 0.86  # 14% reduction for denser coverage
```

**Parameters**:
- `r₀`: Starting radius (typically 50-100ft)
- `r_hold`: Maximum radius (optimized by battery duration)
- `N`: Number of bounces (5-12 based on flight time)
- `Δφ`: Angular step per bounce (radians)
- `α`: Expansion coefficient (reduced by 14% for denser coverage)

### Three-Phase Flight Pattern

1. **Outward Spiral**: Exponential expansion from center to maximum radius
2. **Hold Pattern**: Circular flight at maximum radius
3. **Inward Spiral**: Exponential contraction back to center

## Neural Network Training Optimizations

### Differentiated Altitude Logic

The system implements phase-aware altitude calculation to provide diverse viewing angles for neural network training:

```python
def calculate_waypoint_altitude(waypoint):
    base_elevation = get_terrain_elevation(waypoint.lat, waypoint.lon)
    distance_from_center = calculate_distance(waypoint, center)
    
    if 'outbound' in waypoint.phase or 'hold' in waypoint.phase:
        # Lower altitudes for detail capture
        agl_increment = distance_from_center * 0.37  # feet per foot
        desired_agl = min_height + agl_increment
        
    elif 'inbound' in waypoint.phase:
        # Higher altitudes for context capture
        distance_from_max = max_radius - distance_from_center
        altitude_decrease = distance_from_max * 0.1  # gentle descent
        desired_agl = max_outbound_altitude - altitude_decrease
    
    return base_elevation + desired_agl
```

**Benefits**:
- **Outbound (0.37ft/ft)**: Captures fine details and textures at lower altitudes
- **Inbound (0.1ft/ft)**: Maintains elevated perspective for context and overview
- **Altitude Differential**: Up to 135ft difference at same locations for diverse training data

### Reduced Expansion Rate

The exponential expansion coefficient has been reduced by 14% to create denser waypoint coverage:

```python
# Original: α = ln(r_hold/r₀)/(N*Δφ)
# Optimized: α = ln(r_hold/r₀)/(N*Δφ) * 0.86

alpha = math.log(r_hold / r0) / (N * dphi) * 0.86
```

**Impact**:
- Smaller radial steps between bounces
- 14% increase in waypoint density per spiral area
- Better photo overlap for neural network training
- Smoother flight transitions

## Waypoint Generation Process

### Phase-Based Generation

```python
def generate_spiral_waypoints(params):
    waypoints = []
    
    # Phase 1: Outbound spiral
    for bounce in range(params.N + 1):
        t = bounce * params.dphi
        radius = params.r0 * math.exp(params.alpha * t)
        
        # Add midpoint for smooth flight
        if bounce > 0:
            t_mid = (bounce - 0.5) * params.dphi
            r_mid = params.r0 * math.exp(params.alpha * t_mid)
            waypoints.append(create_waypoint(r_mid, t_mid, 'outbound_mid'))
            
        waypoints.append(create_waypoint(radius, t, 'outbound_bounce'))
    
    # Phase 2: Hold pattern
    t_hold_mid = params.t_out + params.t_hold / 2
    waypoints.append(create_waypoint(params.r_hold, t_hold_mid, 'hold_mid'))
    
    # Phase 3: Inbound spiral
    for bounce in range(params.N):
        t = params.t_hold_end + (bounce + 1) * params.dphi
        radius = params.r_hold * math.exp(-params.alpha * (bounce + 1) * params.dphi)
        waypoints.append(create_waypoint(radius, t, 'inbound_bounce'))
    
    return waypoints
```

### Altitude Calculation

```python
def calculate_altitude_for_waypoints(waypoints):
    max_outbound_altitude = 0
    
    # First pass: Calculate outbound altitudes and track maximum
    for wp in waypoints:
        if 'outbound' in wp.phase or 'hold' in wp.phase:
            distance = calculate_distance_from_center(wp)
            agl_increment = distance * 0.37
            wp.altitude = min_height + agl_increment
            max_outbound_altitude = max(max_outbound_altitude, wp.altitude)
    
    # Second pass: Calculate inbound altitudes using maximum reference
    for wp in waypoints:
        if 'inbound' in wp.phase:
            distance = calculate_distance_from_center(wp)
            distance_from_max = max_radius - distance
            altitude_decrease = distance_from_max * 0.1
            wp.altitude = max_outbound_altitude - altitude_decrease
```

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Considerations

1. **Phase Tracking**: Each waypoint must be tagged with phase information for proper altitude calculation
2. **Maximum Altitude Tracking**: Inbound altitudes depend on maximum outbound altitude
3. **Terrain Following**: All altitudes are AGL (Above Ground Level) with terrain data integration
4. **Safety Margins**: Maintain minimum 100ft AGL for obstacle clearance

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing Midpoints**: Ensure all midpoints are included for smooth flight
2. **Phase Confusion**: Incorrect phase tagging leads to wrong altitude calculations  
3. **Altitude References**: Inbound altitudes must reference maximum outbound, not current position
4. **Expansion Rate**: Don't reduce alpha too much or spiral becomes too dense

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Dynamic Alpha**: Adjust expansion rate based on terrain complexity
2. **Adaptive Altitude**: Modify rates based on ground elevation changes
3. **Multi-Level Spirals**: Implement multiple altitude tiers for complex structures
4. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Integrate no-fly zones and obstacle detection
5. **Weather Adaptation**: Adjust parameters based on wind conditions

### Advanced Features

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models to optimize parameters automatically
2. **Real-time Adaptation**: Modify flight path based on image quality feedback
3. **Multi-Property Missions**: Chain multiple spiral patterns for large areas
4. **Gaussian Splat Optimization**: Tailor patterns for specific 3D reconstruction methods
